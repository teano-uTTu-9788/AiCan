00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Welcome to Ai/O—medical school meets garage radio. I'm Teano.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And I'm Ricky. We tune up your cortex in eight minutes flat—oil change not included.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In this pilot episode, we'll explain what Ai/O is and why we chose the eight‑minute format.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We'll also explore a high‑yield medical concept—SIRS versus sepsis—and wrap up with a lightning quiz.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So, why eight minutes? Research shows our brains love micro‑learning. Eight minutes is long enough for a memorable story but short enough to fit into your commute or coffee break.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We promise a daily dose of humor, mnemonics, and memory palaces. Speaking of memory palaces, let's step into our first one.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Imagine you're standing in an emergency room hallway. The fire alarm's sprinkler is going off—spraying water like a high fever. That's SIRS: the sprinkler (temperature), the alarm beep (heart rate), the smoke (respiratory rate), and the fire brigade's white suits (white blood cell count).

00:02:20.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Now, sepsis isn't just the sprinkler; it's the sprinkler plus a hidden leak. There's infection and organ dysfunction—maybe the water is contaminated, and it's damaging the electrical panel. That's how you remember sepsis.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So, SIRS is a warning system; sepsis is a system in distress. Visualize the hallway every time you need to recall the criteria.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Ready for a quick quiz? We'll ask three questions. Stick around to check your answers in our app after the episode.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Question 1: What does the sprinkler represent in our memory palace? Question 2: Which extra element makes it sepsis? Question 3: Can you name two SIRS criteria besides fever?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:40.000
We'll reveal the answers inside the Ai/O app. It'll keep your streak going—and maybe you'll beat Ricky's high score!

00:05:40.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Remember: daily practice locks in knowledge. That's why we're here every day with eight‑minute episodes.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Invite friends to join the Ai/O community. For every five referrals, you earn a month of premium access—because learning is more fun together.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Thanks for tuning in. Tomorrow we'll dive into another high‑yield topic with a new memory palace.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:08:00.000
This is Teano and Ricky signing off. Now go check your quiz answers and keep that streak alive!
