# Episode 001 — SIRS vs. Sepsis

**Hosts**: Teano and Ricky Jr

**Duration**: 8 minutes

## Cold open (0:00–0:20)

TEANO: "Welcome back to Ai/O Daily — the eight‑minute med lesson that fits between songs on your commute."

RICKY: "And I’m Ricky. Today we're comparing two acronyms you’ve definitely heard: SIRS and sepsis."

## Premise (0:20–1:00)

- Explain what SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) and sepsis mean at a high level.
- Highlight why distinguishing them quickly matters for exams and clinical practice.

## High‑yield bite (1:00–5:30)

Use a memory‑palace in an ER hallway:

- **SIRS** is the "sprinkler alarm" going off in the hallway. Four red sprinklers represent:
  - **Temperature** (fever >38 °C or hypothermia <36°C)
  - **Heart rate** (>90 bpm)
  - **Respiratory rate** (>20 breaths/min or PaCO₂ <32 mm Hg)
  - **White blood cells** (>12,000 or <4,000 cells/mm³)
- **Sepsis** is the "sprinkler alarm + hidden leak." An IV bag leaking behind a curtain signifies suspected infection plus evidence of organ dysfunction.

Discuss how sepsis criteria build on SIRS with the presence of infection and end‑organ damage (e.g., hypotension, lactate >2 mmol/L).

## Lightning quiz (5:30–7:00)

1. Which SIRS criterion involves respiratory rate?
2. In the memory palace, what does the leaking IV bag represent?
3. True or false: Sepsis can be diagnosed without meeting SIRS criteria.

Provide correct answers after the outro.
